## StikZap - CLIE tool for AIBO owners

StikZap is a CLIE program to check and fix certain types of AIBO memory sticks. StikZap tricks the (now defunct) Sony CLIE PDA to access the special pink sticks used by the (now defunct) Sony AIBO. NOTE: StikZap is a backup-like utility. It will save the necessary hardware stick information in a "Safety File" on the memory stick. It is intended for legal uses of making backup copies of software you own (and have legal licence to run). Don't make illegal copies of software.

CLIE models supported

    * Confirmed to work: all known CLIE models
    * AFAIK all PalmOS4 and PalmOS5 devices will work with StikZap (NX, TJ, TH, UX, VZ, NZ, NR, SL and many others). The StikZap program may warn you about "guessing". You can ignore those warnings.
    * The very old (monochrome) PalmOS3 models like the S300 will also work. After running the program, these older CLIEs may crash (there is a problem with the color icons). Simply reset the S300 CLIE and all will be well again

    Version 1.4 includes bug fix for PalmOS 4 devices.
    As always proceed at your own risk.
    Other PDAs won't work. It must be a CLIE (Sony Palm PDA) with a memory stick slot. 

Sticks Detected

    * Over 2 dozen common and not-so-common memory sticks.
    * Includes 8MB and 16MB sticks, and the two different sizes of AiboMind sticks (32MB and 128MB). The Darker blue 128MB AiboMind3 stick also counts as a "pink" stick. 

Sticks Repairable / Zap-able

    * Any stick where you saved a "Safety File" (save it to the memory stick first, then save it to your PC)
    * `PMS` _Programmable Memory sticks_ normally used for free programs like RCODE and Open-R SDK programs. Note `PMS` is a special kind of stick.
    AiboMind (1, 2 or 3) for ERS-7
    Note: PMS And AiboMind are special cases for your convenience (they can be 'zap'ed onto a stick even if you didn't bother to make a Safety File). In these two cases the physical sticks can run many different versions of software. As always, be sure the software you run is legally obtained.
